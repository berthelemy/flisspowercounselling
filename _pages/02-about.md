I started training as a psychotherapist in 2011 following my own experience of being a counselling client. I finally left the corporate world at the end of 2016 after many years of working in financial IT.

I have an MSc in Person-Centred &amp; Experiential Psychotherapy from the Sherwood Psychotherapy Training Institute in Nottingham and have professional registration with UKCP (United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy). I have full professional indemnity insurance with Howden and am DBS checked.

### Experience and Interests

I have experience of working with the wide variety of issues brought to a general counselling service, such as anxiety, life transitions, issues around gender or sexuality, loss, relationship difficulties, depression. I work as a volunteer counsellor at a charity supporting survivors of childhood sexual abuse, but do not currently undertake this work in private practice.

As mentioned earlier, I have knowledge of the corporate world and the stresses and strains which can arise, perhaps from a mismatch between personal and corporate values.
