I started training as a psychotherapist in 2011 as the result of my own experience of being a counselling client. How I work as a counsellor is deeply informed by my personal experience of growth and change.

### Experience and Interests

I have experience of working with the wide variety of issues brought to a general counselling service, including depression, anxiety, low self esteem, life transitions, issues around gender or sexuality, loss and bereavement, relationship difficulties. I have also worked in a domestic violence counselling service. I am currently a volunteer counsellor at a charity supporting survivors of childhood sexual abuse. 

A long career in financial IT means I have personal experience of the corporate world and the stresses and strains which can arise, including mismatches between personal and corporate values.
