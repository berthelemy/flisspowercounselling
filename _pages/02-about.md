---
I started training as a psychotherapist in 2011 as the result of my own experience of being a counselling client. After many years of working in financial IT I finally left the corporate world at the end of 2016, swapping 'bits and bytes' for people.

I have an MSc in Person-Centred &amp; Experiential Psychotherapy (2016) from the Sherwood Psychotherapy Training Institute (SPTI) in Nottingham. I am now a graduate member of SPTI and have professional registration with UKCP (United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy). I abide by the ethical codes of both these organisations. I have full professional indemnity insurance with Howden and am DBS checked.

### Experience and Interests

I have 2 years' experience of working with the wide variety of issues brought to the Nottingham Trent University student counselling service, including anxiety, life transitions, issues around gender or sexuality, loss, relationship difficulties, depression. I have also worked in a domestic violence counselling service. I am currently a volunteer counsellor at a charity supporting survivors of childhood sexual abuse.

As mentioned earlier, I have knowledge of the corporate world and the stresses and strains which can arise, perhaps from a mismatch between personal and corporate values.
