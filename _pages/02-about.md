I started training as a psychotherapist in 2011 following my own experience of being a counselling client. I finally left the corporate world at the end of 2016 after many years of working in financial IT.

I have an MSc in Person-Centred &amp; Experiential Psychotherapy from the Sherwood Psychotherapy Training Institute in Nottingham and have professional registration with UKCP (United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy). I have full professional indemnity insurance with Howden and am DBS checked.
