I started training as a psychotherapist in 2011 as the result of my own experience of being a counselling client.

I have an MSc in Person-Centred &amp; Experiential Psychotherapy from the Sherwood Psychotherapy Training Institute (SPTI) in Nottingham. I am a graduate member of SPTI and have professional registration with UKCP (United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy). I abide by the ethical codes of both these organisations. I have full professional indemnity insurance with Howden and am DBS checked.

### Experience and Interests

I have experience of working with the wide variety of issues brought to the Nottingham Trent University student counselling service, including depression, anxiety, life transitions, issues around gender or sexuality, loss, relationship difficulties. I have also worked in a domestic violence counselling service. I am currently a volunteer counsellor at a charity supporting survivors of childhood sexual abuse.

I have personal experience of the corporate world and the stresses and strains which can arise, perhaps from a mismatch between personal and corporate values.
