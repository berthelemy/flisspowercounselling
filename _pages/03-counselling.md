I work with individuals, offering a non-judgemental, empathic relationship to explore what is going on for you in your life, whether the need is targeted short-term counselling, or longer-term psychotherapy for deeper issues. I particularly work with issues around identity, sexuality and gender, low mood and depression, anxious feelings, loss and bereavement.

I work in a person-centred/experiential way, which means that I believe that you are the expert in your own life and that you will be able to find your own unique way forward, however hard that may seem right now. I like Maria Villas-Boas Bowen's metaphor of therapist as Sherpa; a knowledgeable companion who accompanies the traveller, perhaps pointing things out on the way, but who doesn't decide the route.

In the person-centred approach the relationship between client and counsellor is key, so the most important thing is that you find a counsellor who feels right for you. This can seem daunting, especially if you haven’t tried counselling before, but trust your instinct. However you first contact me I suggest a phone call to arrange a first session during which we can explore what has brought you to counselling and whether we think we can work together.

I offer sessions from premises in the S11 area of Sheffield, with access up one flight of stairs.

The premises are private and safe with plenty of on-street parking. The 88/83 (not 83a) buses serve the area. 


I work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with early and late appointments available. 
 
### Fees:

All appointments are £45 for 60 minutes.

I do not have any concessionary rates available at the moment.
