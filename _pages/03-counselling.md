**My counselling service will be launched in December 2017/January 2018.**

I work with individuals, offering a non-judgemental, empathic relationship to explore what is going on for you in your life, whether the need is targeted short-term counselling, or longer-term psychotherapy for deeper issues. 

I work in a person-centred/experiential way, which means that I believe that you are the expert in your own life, and that you can find your own unique way forward, however hard that may seem right now. 

The most important thing is that you find a counsellor/therapist who is right for you. This can feel daunting, especially if you haven’t tried counselling before, but trust your instinct. However you first contact me I suggest a phone call to arrange a first session, when we can explore what has brought you to counselling and whether we think we can work together.

I offer an initial appointment from premises on Abbeydale Road, Sheffield, with subsequent sessions from premises in the S11 area of Sheffield. In both cases access is up one flight of stairs.

My S11 premises are private and safe with plenty of on-street parking and 81/83 bus stops about a 10 minute walk away.
