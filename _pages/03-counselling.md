I work with individuals, offering an acceptant, warm and compassionate relationship to explore what is going on for you in your life, whether the need is targeted short-term counselling, or longer-term psychotherapy for deeper issues. I particularly work with issues around low mood and depression, anxious feelings, low self esteem, loss and bereavement, identity, sexuality and gender, although what's going on for us often isn't so easy to categorise.

I work in a person-centred/experiential way, which means that I believe that you are the expert in your own life and that you will be able to find your own unique way forward, however hard that may seem right now. I like Maria Villas-Boas Bowen's metaphor of therapist as Sherpa; a knowledgeable companion who accompanies the traveller, pointing things out on the way, but who doesn't decide the overall route.
I hope that as we work together you will develop improved self-awareness and self-compassion, which will equip you well to handle future issues.

In the person-centred approach the relationship between client and counsellor is key, so I suggest a phone call to arrange an initial session during which we can explore what has brought you to counselling and see how we get on together.

I offer sessions from premises in the S11 area of Sheffield, with access up one flight of stairs.

The premises are private and safe with plenty of on-street parking. The 88/83 (not 83a) buses serve the area. 


I work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with early and late appointments available (last appointment 7pm). 
 
### Fees:

All appointments are £45 for 60 minutes, payable on the day by cash, bank transfer or Paym (payment by mobile phone).

I offer a concessionary rate of £38 to counselling trainees.
