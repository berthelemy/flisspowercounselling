**My counselling service will be launched in January 2018.**

I work with individuals, offering a non-judgemental, empathic relationship to explore what is going on for you in your life, whether the need is targeted short-term counselling, or longer-term psychotherapy for deeper issues. I particularly work with issues around identity, sexuality and gender, low mood and depression, anxious feelings, loss and bereavement.

I work in a person-centred/experiential way, which means that I believe that you are the expert in your own life and that you will be able to find your own unique way forward, however hard that may seem right now. I like Maria Villas-Boas Bowen's metaphor of therapist as Sherpa; a knowledgeable companion who accompanies the traveller, perhaps pointing things out on the way, but who doesn't decide the route.

In the person-centred approach the relationship between client and counsellor is key, so the most important thing is that you find a counsellor who feels right for you. This can seem daunting, especially if you haven’t tried counselling before, but trust your instinct. However you first contact me I suggest a phone call to arrange a first session, when we can explore what has brought you to counselling and whether we think we can work together.

I offer a reduced price initial appointment from premises on Abbeydale Road, Sheffield, with subsequent sessions from premises in the S11 area of Sheffield. In both cases access is up one flight of stairs.

My S11 premises are private and safe with plenty of on-street parking and 81/83 bus stops about a 10 minute walk away. 


I work on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with early and late appointments available. 
 
### Fees:

Initial meeting: £30 for 50 minutes. Subsequent meetings: £45 for 60 minutes

I do not offer any concessionary rates at the moment.
