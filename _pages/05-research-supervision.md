### What I offer 

As well as working as a counsellor/psychotherapist I offer Person-Centred research supervision to students undertaking qualitative research as part of counselling/psychotherapy training up to Masters level.  I offer verbal (phone, Zoom, WhatsApp, face-to-face) and/or written support as research ideas are developed, drawing on my own knowledge and experience to offer suggestions and feedback.

I do not offer academic supervision but training organisations often provide courses/advice on essay structure and development of an academic argument etc. and there are many academic proofreading services.

### About Me

I have an MSc in Person-Centred & Experiential Psychotherapy (2016, Distinction) from the Sherwood Psychotherapy Training Institute (SPTI) in Nottingham.

My MSc research was an autoethnographic exploration of gender expression and as part of my MSc award I also undertook clinical research in which I particularly drew on Warner’s (2005,2007) Model of Process Vulnerability. 

### Fees:

£35 per hour, including for any contracted reading time prior to discussion, payable by cash, bank transfer or Paym (payment by mobile phone) on the day of discussion.
