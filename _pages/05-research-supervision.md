### What I offer 

As well as working as a counsellor/psychotherapist I offer Person-Centred research supervision to students undertaking qualitative research, most especially autoethnographic research, as part of counselling/psychotherapy training up to Masters level.  I offer verbal (phone, Skype, face-to-face) and/or written support as research ideas are developed, drawing on my own knowledge and experience to offer suggestions and feedback.

I do not supervise quantitative or mixed-methods research, nor do I offer academic supervision. Training organisations often provide courses/advice on essay structure and development of an academic argument etc. and there are many academic proofreading services.

### About Me

I have an MSc in Person-Centred & Experiential Psychotherapy (2015, Distinction) from the Sherwood Psychotherapy Training Institute (SPTI) in Nottingham.

My MSc research was an autoethnographic exploration of gender expression. As part of my MSc award I also undertook clinical research in which I particularly drew on Warner’s (2005,2007) Model of Process Vulnerability. 

I am particularly interested in autoethnographic research and LGBTQ+ perspectives.

### Fees:

£35 per hour, including any contracted reading time prior to discussion.
