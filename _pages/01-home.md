Sometimes we can struggle to cope with what life throws at us. Maybe we know why, or maybe the reason is less clear or all we know is that we ‘don&#39;t feel right’.

Although friends and family often want to help, sometimes it can be helpful to have someone independent to talk to, someone who won&#39;t tell us what to do and who offers an empathic, non-judgemental presence, allowing exploration of sensitive or painful issues.

I believe that given the space to explore and understand our own experiencing, we can all find the way forward that is right for us.
