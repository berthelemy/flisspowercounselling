### Is there a difference between counselling and psychotherapy?

My view is that counselling tends to be shorter-term work, possibly with a specific aim, whereas psychotherapy refers to longer-term work exploring deeper issues.

### What sort of counselling/psychotherapy should I choose?

There are many different approaches to counselling/psychotherapy, with different perspectives on how change happens, what is helpful and the nature of the therapeutic relationship. When choosing a counsellor/psychotherapist the most important thing is that you feel they are trustworthy. UKCP and other professional organisations offer help on how to choose: https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/about-psychotherapy/choosing-a-psychotherapist/

### How many sessions will I need?

It is impossible to predict this up-front. Sometimes a small number of sessions can make a big difference. I am available for both short term and open-ended long-term therapy if this seems appropriate.

### Is counselling confidential?

In the vast majority of circumstances, yes. I abide by United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) and Sherwood Psychotherapy Training Institute (SPTI) ethical codes. Exceptions include safeguarding of vulnerable adults/children, terrorism or drug trafficking offences. Where possible I would discuss with you first.

### Do you work with children or couples?

No, I am not trained in couples counselling or child psychotherapy.
